edc is an MVC microframework written in PHP, what fits in 1k ... or 2 ;).

It was inspired by Camping microframework ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camping_(microframework) ). I have also used concepts from symfony ( http://www.symfony-project.org/ ) and django ( http://www.djangoproject.com/ ).

Concept:
--------
 - e.inc: 
     Responsible for dispatch the request, load the affected controller.
     A controller can handle a request if it's uri is matching with the request uri and has a method that name is suited to actual HTTP method. In edc the contorller has no parent class.
     Every controller must return with a response object.
 - c.inc:
     Holds the controller classes.
 - r.inc:
    Request and response object container.
    The request object is a simple data container. You can get request parameters through 4 methods: param(), file(), header(), cookie(). All getter has 2 parameter: name of the parameter and a default return value.
    The response object is a prototype of a possible response. The framework has only one assumption about response object: it has a send() method.

Extra files:
 - b.inc:
     Simple bootstrap file, used by the custom c.inc.
 - d.inc:
     Some defaults. It contains a 404 error handler class.
